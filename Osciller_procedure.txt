Procedure to build an osciller if the revese action of the
power amplifier can be be neglected)

1) Evaluate the maximum available power gain using the Z paraters
(NB if the Z12 ~ 0, the amplifier is unconditionally stable)

Ga = abs(Z21)^2/(4*Re(Z11)*Re(Z22))

Oscillator can operate at frequencies such that Ga>1

2) We compensate some reactance at input and output at the frequency
   chosen for oscillation, so that Z11 and Z22 are purely resistive

3) We choose a RL so that the operating gain is about 1.1, 1.2.


4) We calculate an impedance transformer so that the input impedance
transform in the one chosen (Z0).

5) We estimate the phase shift theta and we add a transmission line 
made with a simmetric T network with

     Xa = -Z0 * tan(theta/2)
     Xb = X0 * csc(theta)
